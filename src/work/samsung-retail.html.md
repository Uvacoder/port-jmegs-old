Samsung maintains a TV demo area in large electronics retailers like Best Buy and Costco nationwide. Lacking a consistent model for the userâ€™s experience, the system both was hard for customers to understand and for Samsung to keep from breaking. Our team designed a simpler, consistent, and more intuitive interaction model AND an architecture that Samsung could replicate and maintain at over 1,000 locations. The new experience doubled consumer understanding of product features while maintaining a record 98% uptime rate.
