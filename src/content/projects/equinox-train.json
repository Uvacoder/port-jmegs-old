    "challenge": "Equinox customers pay a premium for access to world-class fitness instruction, but Equinox trainers were using spreadsheets, personal text messages, and an ancient web app to manage their clients and track workouts. The lack of a seamless client experience meant customers werenâ€™t seeing enough value to renew their subscriptions, causing the training business to decline year over year. My teamâ€™s challenge was to create new value for training clients by reducing the administrative overhead for trainers.",
    "approach": "The project started with a 6 week immersive research & discovery phase â€“Â getting deep into personal training and the existing Equinox technical architecture. We then executed our solution in two week sprints, each ending with a prototype reviewed by a panel of personal trainers.",
    "outcomes": "After a pilot period in one club, the resulting web app had a phased rollout to all Equinox clubs in the US. Companion features were also added to the consumer Equinox app. In early feedback, trainers rated the new experience highly and confirmed that it was adding value for their clients."
