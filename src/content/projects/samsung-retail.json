    "challenge": "Samsung maintains a TV demo area in every Best Buy store in the country. As the experience grew over time without a standardized interaction model, it became increasingly hard for customers to understand and for Samsung to maintain. To solve this problem my team had to not only design a more intuitive interaction model, but do so in a way that Samsung could replicate and maintain at over 1,000 locations.",
    "approach": "I led a highly collaborative design process that relied on rapid physical prototyping and close collaboration with hardware and software engineers. We built and iterated on a full-scale replica of the installation at the office to go from paper sketch to physical experience in no time flat.",
    "outcomes": "After rolling out nationwide, the resulting new experience has doubled consumer understanding of product features in-store while a maintaining 98% average uptime."

      "blurb": "Understanding how salespeople and customers interact in the physical space was the number one priority for exploration. To validate the spatial and content approaches, I led the team through live action roleplaying exercises between salesperson and customer. The key takeaway: keep a flat hierarchy. Going more than one level deep in an interface to make something happen derails the conversation.",
